/// **Why this is written out rather than imported.** The telemetry envelope
/// carries a sha256 of the uploaded blob, and the server refuses to score a
/// blob whose hash does not match — that check is what makes re-scoring
/// honest. Computing it needs `CryptoKit`, which exists on a phone and not on
/// Linux, so with the hash in the app layer the *one* number that binds a
/// drive to its data could never be tested on this machine, and the fixture
/// the server is held to had to be hand-written.
///
/// It is ~70 lines of a fully specified algorithm with published test
/// vectors, which is a better trade than an untestable upload path or a
/// package dependency. It is **not** a general-purpose crypto library: no
/// HMAC, no streaming, no constant-time comparison. Nothing here is used for
/// authentication — the nonce hashing at sign-in stays on CryptoKit, where
/// Apple maintains it.
